- Split dwm launch code/loop into separate script; on quit, kill that process instead of xinit.
  - This goes hand in hand with having dzen/conky be restarted when dwm is respawned using Ctrl+R; currently
    dwm respawns on top of dzen/conky, so we need a way to kill those processes and bring them back after
    we respawn dwm.
(Both these TODOs above involve creating new scripts from the contents of xinitrc and linking them in some manner.)
